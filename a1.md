Question 1:
    - Start: Is run when the object is initiliazed.
    - Update: Runs the code every frame. 

Question 2:
    - Raycast: is a like a laser beam from a given object. For our use case its the direction we are looking. 
    - Could also be a ray from a hand or something that tells what direction or what we are aiming at.
